# 🤖 Karakuri Agent

日本語版はこちら [README_JP.md](README_JP.md).

**Karakuri Agent** is an open-source project aiming to create an **AI agent** accessible from any environment—whether it's a smart speaker, chat tool, or web application. By integrating various endpoints and services, it aims to realize a world where you can **access a single agent** from **anywhere**.  
You can also define multiple agents simultaneously, each with unique roles, personalities, voices, and models.

## Technical Overview

### 🚀 **Server-Side**
- Framework: FastAPI

### 🪶 **Model Support (LLM)**
By utilizing LiteLLM, you can access models supported by [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm), such as OpenAI and Ollama.  
- **Example for OpenAI models**: Obtain an [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/) and configure it in `.env`.  
- **Example for Ollama models**: Run [Ollama](https://docs.ollama.ai/) locally and set its URL in `.env`.

### 🎙️ **Text-To-Speech (TTS)**

| Service            | Support Status        |
|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Voicevox Engine     | 🟢 Supported          |
| AivisSpeech Engine  | 🟢 Supported          |
| Niji Voice API      | 🟢 Supported          |
| OpenAI              | ❌ Not supported yet (planned) |
| Style-Bert-VITS2    | ❌ Not supported yet (planned) |

**Example for VoicevoxEngine Setup**:  
VoicevoxEngine must be running locally.  
Follow the [official documentation](https://github.com/VOICEVOX/voicevox_engine) to start it.  
Then set the endpoint (e.g., `http://localhost:50021`) in `AGENT_1_TTS_BASE_URL` within your `.env` file.

### 🎧 **Speech-To-Text (STT)**

| Service         | Support Status        |
|-----------------|-----------------------|
| faster-whisper  | 🟢 Supported          |
| OpenAI Whisper  | ❌ Not supported yet (planned) |

`faster-whisper` works as a Python library and does not require an external service.  
Once installed via `requirements.txt`, it's ready to use.

### **Endpoints**

| Endpoint        | Support Status             |
|-----------------|----------------------------|
| text to text    | 🟢 Supported               |
| text to voice   | 🟢 Supported               |
| text to video   | ❌ Not supported yet (planned) |
| voice to text   | 🟢 Supported               |
| voice to voice  | 🟢 Supported               |
| voice to video  | ❌ Not supported yet (planned) |
| video to text   | ❌ Not supported yet (planned) |
| video to voice  | ❌ Not supported yet (planned) |
| video to video  | ❌ Not supported yet (planned) |

### **Service Integrations**

| Service  | Support Status             |
|----------|----------------------------|
| LINE     | 🟢 Supported               |
| Slack    | ❌ Not supported yet (planned) |

  - Python 3.8 or later  
  - (Optional) VoicevoxEngine for TTS  
    - Run VoicevoxEngine locally and set the URL in `.env`.  
  - (Optional) For LINE integration, obtain tokens and a secret from the [LINE Developer Console](https://developers.line.biz/en/).

- **LLM Model Usage**  
  - Requires valid API keys and an internet connection.

- **Ollama Model Usage**  
  - Requires Ollama running locally.

## 🛠️ Installation

### Using Docker Compose

If you have `compose.yml` at the project root, you can start the server with Docker Compose.

```bash
docker compose up
```
The above command will start the server at `http://localhost:8080`.

Make sure to set up `.env` beforehand.

### Manual Setup: Server-Side

1. Copy and edit `.env` as needed:  
   ```bash
   cp example.env .env
   ```
   Configure agents, models, API keys, etc. in `.env`.
   
2. Install required packages:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Start the server:  
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
   ```
   → Server will run at `http://localhost:8080`.

## 💡 Usage

- Check and interact with the API format via Swagger UI:  
  `http://localhost:8080/docs`
